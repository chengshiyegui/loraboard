## Install

This web app was developed using a template generated by the [yeoman web-app generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp). Follow the steps and it should be ok.

## Developers

Please note that this a simple JS script without any architecture effort or framework usage. It's provided as-is and you may want to achieve some decoupling with some awesome livraries such as http://backbonejs.org/. There are no tests at all (which is _bad_!)
