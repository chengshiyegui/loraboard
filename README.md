## Setup

### LoRaMote (end point)

Follow the Semtech user guide to setup the LoRaMote device.

### LoRa gateway

You must stop the current packet forwarder and change its configuration files.

* In local.conf, change the gateway ID
* In global.conf, change the gateway ID, point to lorio service and be sure that the port values are correct:
```
   "gateway_ID": "B827EBFFFF6F8A98",
   /* change with default server address/ports, or overwrite in local_conf.json */
   "server_address": "mq.loriot.io",
   "serv_port_up": 1780,
   "serv_port_down": 1780,
```
You can then restart the packet forwarder and check its initial output which displays the current settings (gateway ID, server and port)

### Loriot service

// TBD

### Pubnub service

// TBD

### Web application
This web app was developed using a template generated by the [yeoman web-app generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp). Follow the steps and it should be ok.

Just run the following command to serve the single page app and open your browser to http://localhost:9000:
```
gulp serve
```

## Developers

Please note that this a simple JS script without any architecture effort or framework usage. It's provided as-is and you may want to achieve some decoupling with some awesome livraries such as http://backbonejs.org/. There are no tests at all (which is _bad_!)
